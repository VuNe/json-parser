# Git Branch Name Guidelines

## Git Branch Name Structure
- The name should summarize what the changes in the branch achieve (the intent)
- Try to stay between two and fine words
- Include the JIRA issue key as the first entry in the branch name
- The JIRA issue should be separated with a `/` from the rest of the branch name 

## Example Format
```
ABC-001/add_header_middleware
```

Create Jira issues based on an provided implementation plan.

Please follow the workflow below carefully to create the Jira issues successfully.

## Workflow

1. Read the provided implementation plan. If no plan file is provided, ask for it and continue only when the file is provided.
2. Identify the key steps in the plan that can be translated into Jira issues
3. For each step, create a Jira issue with the following details:
   - **Summary**: A concise title for the issue
   - **Description**: A detailed description of the task, including the goal and deliverables
   - **Type**: Set the issue type to "Task"
4. Provide a summary of the Jira issues created to the human developer.

DO NOT DO ANYTHING ELSE THAN CREATING THE JIRA ISSUES! E.g. do not implement any code or initialize anything.

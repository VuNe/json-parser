Design the architecture of a project based on an provided implementation plan.

Follow the workflow below carefully to design the architecture successfully.

If you draw diagrams or charts, use the mermaid chart format for visually appealing diagrams.

## Workflow

1. Read the provided implementation plan. If no plan file is provided, ask for it and continue only when the file is provided.
2. Understand the technical requirements and constraints of the project
3. Identify the key components and their interactions based on the plan
4. Design a simple architecture that is easy to extend and maintain
5. Validate the architecture by double checking it against the implementation plan
6. Document the architecture in `docs/architecture.md`

DO NOT DO ANYTHING ELSE THAN DESIGNING THE ARCHITECTURE IN THE `docs/architecture.md` FILE! E.g. do not implement any code or initialize anything.
